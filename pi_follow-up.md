# PI Follow-up
## Societal & Cultural Trends in PI
- "Dominance" in PI seems to address differences in collaborativity and individualism. Are any notable trends found cross-culturally? Are there any trends among individualist vs collectivist cultures?
- Having been translated into at least 70 languages, how has the PI changed over time in response?
- Languages like Hawaiian often have "dual meanings" (koana) that could present unique challenges for the process; have problems been realized across languages whose definitions are objective/concrete vs subjective/topical?
- Assessments like PI likely share commonalities with polls in that the effects of framing are highly prominent. What efforts have been made to mitigate this impact and has this changed over time?
## Time-based Trends in PI
- Employing PI as part of the hiring process allows for a "baseline" to be set as candidates are brought a given role. Have any studies been done to investigate how PI changes over time? If so, can correlations be found for a given role, team structure, or even for a whole organization?
- Making the distinction between "self" and "self-concept" allows for interesting insight at a given moment in time. Are any trends found for an individual over time in relation to how these converge or diverge?
## Patience vs Formality
In contrast to other topics, this will likely be the most subjective and most attributed to my lack of understanding. As described, I anticipated these would have fairly strong correlations between one another and was surprised to find that they were my most divergent traits.
- PI describes **Patience** as "the drive to have consistency and stability" and **Formality** as "the drive to conform to rules and structure." Within these definitions, how do stability and structure contrast?
- Similarly, PI attributes low patience to someone "comfortable with change" while a low formality can indicate "flexible, informal, and adaptable." What drives these to be part of separate attributes instead of being synonymous?
## Additional Resources
- Apart from the PI website, what other resources are available to help better understand its usage and how it compares/contrasts to other indices?
- Have any peer-reviewed studies been done on PI or studies that reference PI?
- Is there any data to compare/contrast organizations that have implemented PI to show its impact pre- and post-implementation?
